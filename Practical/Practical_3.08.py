# Task 8

# Try inputting two expressions that use operator chaining and are equivalent to
# the two expressions shown below. (Note: you may first want to first assign values to
# the ‘weight’ and ‘height’ variables for testing purposes)
# 100 < weight and weight < 200
#
# height > 131 and height < 160


# Output:

# length = 200
# depth = 60
# 170 < length and length < 220
# True
# 20 < depth and depth < 80
# True
